<!--where to write script code body or head-->
<!--the problem og writing script in head is blocking!! :P the brower must stop processing the page untill the script is 
downloaded, parsed, executed

place library script such as jquery at the head
place normal scrit in head unless it become performance issue/page load issue
place script that implace the render of the page at the end of body means before ending body tag-->

<!--Doubts
